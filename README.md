## 📚 Course Overview

This repository contains **two independent, comprehensive courses** that can be taken separately or together:

### 🤖 [Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning Workshop](ml/README.md)

**Focus:** Building AI agents from fundamentals to complex game environments

- **13 lessons** covering Python, PyTorch, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning
- **Progressive path:** From NumPy basics → PyTorch → RL theory → DQN → Policy Gradients → Rocket League bots
- **Duration:** 60-80 hours over 8-12 weeks
- **Audience:** Developers with basic programming knowledge
- **Capstone:** Build AI agents for complex 3D environments

**What you'll learn:**
- Deep learning fundamentals with PyTorch
- Reinforcement learning theory (MDPs, Q-learning, DQN, PPO)
- Game AI and continuous control
- Multi-agent systems and advanced RL techniques

### 🔍 [Binary Reverse Engineering: Windows Edition](reverse-engineering/README.md)

**Focus:** Professional-level binary analysis, unpacking, and deobfuscation

- **24 lessons** organized in **3 experience-based courses** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- **Progressive mastery:** From PE format basics → dynamic analysis → unpacking → commercial protectors → professional reversing
- **Duration:** 30-45 hours total (10-15 hours per level)
- **Audience:** Senior software engineers comfortable with systems programming
- **Capstone:** Unpack and analyze professionally protected binaries

**What you'll learn:**
- PE file format and Windows binary structure
- Static analysis with Binary Ninja
- Dynamic analysis with x64dbg
- Binary patching and DLL injection
- Defeating packers and obfuscation
- Analyzing commercial protectors (VMProtect, Themida)
- Professional-level reversing techniques
